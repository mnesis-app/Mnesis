We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behavior

- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Show empathy toward other community members.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information (physical or email addresses) without explicit permission.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **julien@mnesis.app**. All reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the reporter.
